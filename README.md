# What is GLGE_Math


GLGE_Math is the math module of my game engine library (Graphic Library Game Engine). It is spezialized on linear algebra, because linear algebra is important for game developement. 

## Why I am writing this library

This library is designed to be easy to understand and should be easy to extend in the future. It also should (but this should be obvious) fast and easy to use. The combination of both is nothing I have found jet. 
GML is a fast and huge math library, but is complicated with the inheritance, typedefs and template patterns. Another drawback with GML is, that GML has (as far as i know) no C interface. 
But because all GLGE-related libraries support both C++ as well as C, a C interface is required. 

# Features

Currently, only a subset of all planed features is supported as developement on the GLGE library set is still continuing. 

## Currently supported features
